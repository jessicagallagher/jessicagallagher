# :question: JEOPARDY!

## Description

Welcome to my :unicorn: version of Jeopardy! This release includes very basic functionality. The user plays against himself.
1\. Select one of five software engineering-themed categories, and click on the dollar amount to reveal the question.

2.  Adhering to Jeopardy's game format, the question is phrased as an answer, and the user can select one of four questions.

3.  After making a selection, the user will find out whether he was correct or incorrect, along with how many points he earned or lost.

4.  Lather, rinse, repeat!

5.  For now, the way to win the game is... don't lose! If the user reaches a score of -$9,000, the user will be alerted that the game is now over and the board will reset. This value was chosen because it's impossible to redeem yourself after losing that much!

What are you waiting for? Check it out [here](https://jessicagallagher.github.io/jeopardy/index.html)!
